The Queens are a band featuring rich, 3-part, sassy, all-girl harmonies flavoured with jazz, blues and humour; these Melbourne Westies are fast becoming a musical tour de force.

The girls convinced four assorted Punk, Rock, Jazz, and Blues instrumentalists that they would enjoy playing behind three harmonising singers,and a ukulele.

We've never looked back.
