In 1936, American songwriter, violinist, and pianist Billy Hill wrote a tune called “The Glory of Love.” That same year, Benny Goodman and his orchestra produced the first recording of the song, with vocals performed by Helen Ward.

*Recorded at the Newport Hub, during the Newport Jazz Festival 2023.*
