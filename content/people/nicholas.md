We borrow Nicholas from [Dandelion Wine](https://www.dandelionwine.band/). That's very kind of them because we love him and his lovely green guitar.

Here is Nicholas in his other life, he's on dulcimer and hammer dulcimer in the opening piece.
Naomi, his partner and one of our backup singers is playing the lovely green guitar.
