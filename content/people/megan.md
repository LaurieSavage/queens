Megan has a lovely voice and flits between singing originals with groups like the Angelicats, Jazz at the Albert Park Boathouse on Sundays and singing with us. She is a versatile, and busy person who enjoys downtime sitting with a good book somewhere in the bush with her guitar playing partner, Fris.

Megan introduced us to this lovely song.
